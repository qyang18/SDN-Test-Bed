DcellTopo vs Fattree(Fault Tolerant, bandwidth usage):
I want to compare the fault tolerance between 2 different topologies by randomly select links and let them down, then check how many nodes in the topology are still reachible.

Also I want to compare their bandwidth usage by TCP transmitting the same amount of data in both the topoloies, and check the aggregate throughput under both topologies.(the result may vary by the way you select iperf client and server)
